       "'1. RAM and Price Range: There is a strong positive correlation between RAM and price range. As the RAM capacity increases, the price range also tends to increase. This indicates that higher RAM capacity smartphones are priced higher in the market.\\n\\n2. Camera Features: The number of front and rear cameras (fc and pc) does not show a clear trend with price range. However, there is a slight increase in price range with higher pixel resolution in the rear camera (px_height and px_width).\\n\\n3. Battery Power: There is no clear trend between battery power and price range. This suggests that battery power alone may not be a significant factor in determining the price of a smartphone.\\n\\n4. Internal Memory: There is a positive correlation between internal memory (int_memory) and price range. Higher internal memory capacity smartphones are priced higher.\\n\\n5. Display Size: The screen height (sc_h) and screen width (sc_w) do not show a strong correlation with price range. This indicates that display size may not be a significant factor in determining the price of a smartphone.\\n\\n6. Connectivity Features: Dual SIM (dual_sim), 4G (four_g), 3G (three_g), touch screen, and Wi-Fi have varying impacts on the price range. Smartphones with these features tend to have higher price ranges.\\n\\n7. Processor Speed: Clock speed (clock_speed) and number of cores (n_cores) show no clear trend with price range. This suggests that processor speed and number of cores may not be significant factors in determining the price of a smartphone.\\n\\n8. Weight and Thickness: Mobile weight (mobile_wt) and mobile depth (m_dep) do not show a clear trend with price range. This indicates that the physical dimensions of a smartphone may not be significant factors in determining its price.\\n\\n9. Talk Time: There is no clear trend between talk time and price range. This suggests that talk time may not be a significant factor in determining the price of a smartphone.\\n\\nOverall, the analysis shows that RAM capacity, internal memory, connectivity features, and camera resolution are important factors in determining the price range of smartphones. Other factors such as battery power, processor speed, and physical dimensions may not have a significant impact on pricing.'"
