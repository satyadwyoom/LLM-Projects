      "At OYO Rooms, Satyadwyoom Kumar worked as a Senior Data Scientist with a focus on Dynamic Pricing, Stuck Classification, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). His key responsibilities and achievements include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Engineered a statistical model for dynamic pricing: Satyadwyoom developed a statistical model for dynamic pricing, which resulted in a significant reduction in operational costs by $28,000 per month. This model likely involved analyzing market trends, competitor pricing, and customer behavior to optimize pricing strategies for maximum profitability.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Developed a method for optimal pricing prediction: Satyadwyoom implemented a method that employed a cost/impact-based sorting algorithm on moving averages of accepted prices. This approach likely involved analyzing historical pricing data and customer responses to determine the optimal pricing strategy that maximizes revenue while minimizing overhead costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Price bucketed escalations for optimal pricing: Additionally, Satyadwyoom implemented price bucketed escalations to predict optimal prices at minimal overhead cost. This likely involved segmenting customers based on their price sensitivity and preferences to create targeted pricing strategies that maximize revenue and customer satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, Satyadwyoom's work at OYO Rooms as a Senior Data Scientist focused on developing and implementing advanced pricing strategies to optimize revenue, reduce operational costs, and improve overall business performance.\n"
